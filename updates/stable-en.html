<p><strong>V2.3.2 Final Version</strong></p><br/>
<p>Changelog:<br/>Add syscall interception<br/>Remove maps interception (Because it is meaningless. Though I am
    lazy to remove it from UI)<br/>Support Zygisk (<strong>Be sure to remove the old Magisk module first!</strong>)</p><br/>
<p>It has been a long time since the last version was released. Due to various trivial matters, HMA will stop
    updating. This means that V2.3.2 will probably be the last version of this project, but there are still a lot of
    known bugs (If the Magisk module is enabled with the Xposed module disabled, it will cause bootloop; After
    switching on file interception, some banks are not functioning properly). </p><br/>
<p>Note: <strong>Uninstall old Magisk extension</strong> before updating to V2.3.2, then install the new one via the
    install button in the app. If you encounter unable to get root access, please manually extract the installer
    from the apk and rename it to <code>Riru-HideMyApplist.zip</code> or <code>Zygisk-HideMyApplist.zip</code> and
    install it manually with the <code>magisk --install-module zippath</code> command. </p><br/>
<p>Although HMA is suspended, you are still welcome to submit translations or fix PRs, and if you want to join the
    discussion group, please check the first pinned message in the Telegram channel. My new app is still on
    development, but it&#39;s not clear when the first preview version will be released. Thank you all for your
    support along the way, and I look forward to seeing you all on the new journey as we part for the better. </p>
